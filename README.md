## 🎨 Website Design & Technical Choices

### **Design Philosophy**
This portfolio website is built with a modern, clean aesthetic featuring:
- **Color Scheme:** Royal Blue (#4169E1) as primary accent with light blue gradients
- **Typography:** Google Sans for clean, professional appearance
- **Layout:** Centered, responsive design with smooth gradient transitions between sections
- **Accessibility:** WCAG-compliant with proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML

### **Technical Stack**

**Languages Used:**
- **HTML** - Semantic HTML5 with comprehensive meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), and accessibility features
- **CSS** - Vanilla CSS3 with CSS Variables, flexbox, CSS Grid, smooth gradients, and media queries for responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Minimal vanilla JavaScript for smooth scrolling, active link highlighting, and navigation functionality

### **Architecture & Features**

**Frontend Framework:** No frameworks—vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for optimal performance and zero dependencies

**Key Design Features:**
1. **Transparent Navbar** - 50% opacity with backdrop blur effect for modern glassmorphism
2. **Gradient Backgrounds** - Smooth color transitions between sections using CSS linear gradients
3. **Timeline Experience Section** - Alternating left/right card layout (desktop) with centered blue timeline, collapses to single column on mobile
4. **Responsive Grid System** - CSS Grid and Flexbox for skills, education, and certifications sections
5. **Smooth Animations** - CSS keyframe animations for fade-in-up effects on scroll
6. **Mobile-First Approach** - Mobile navbar stays horizontal with compact sizing instead of stacking vertically

**Code Organization:**
- Modular CSS sections with clear comments
- Mobile breakpoints at 768px (tablets) and 480px (small phones)
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- No inline styles—all styling in external stylesheet

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Single CSS file (~20KB)
- Minimal JavaScript (1.5KB) - no frameworks or heavy libraries
- Font Awesome CDN for icons
- Google Fonts for typography
- Smooth scroll behavior using native CSS

**Accessibility Features:**
- Semantic HTML5 (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper meta tags for mobile responsiveness
- JSON-LD structured data for search engines
- Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
- Good color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on interactive elements
